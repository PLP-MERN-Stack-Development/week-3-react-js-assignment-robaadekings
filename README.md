 Task Manager – Built with React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui

The Task Manager project is a responsive and modern web application designed to help users manage their daily tasks efficiently. Built using React as the core UI library, the project takes full advantage of Vite's blazing-fast development environment to deliver a smooth and responsive experience. Styling is handled with Tailwind CSS, enabling utility-first design that keeps the UI clean and consistent, while shadcn/ui provides beautifully prebuilt components that are fully accessible and easy to integrate.

Users can create, update, and delete tasks, with the option to mark them as completed or active. The interface supports task filtering by status and includes a search function to quickly find specific tasks. The application is designed with nice background mode support, making it comfortable to use in any environment. All interactions are designed to be intuitive and fast, thanks to the combination of React’s reactivity and shadcn/ui’s headless component architecture.

To set up the project locally, simply clone the repository, install dependencies using npm or pnpm, and start the development server with `npm run dev`. The project is organized with reusable components in the `components/` directory, page-level containers in `pages/`, and additional utilities and hooks that support the application logic. This structure makes it easy to extend the project or integrate new features as needed.

shadcn/ui is used for its elegant design system and customizable headless components that integrate seamlessly with Tailwind CSS. Developers can add new components to the project with a single command (`npx shadcn-ui@latest add [component]`), enabling fast iteration while maintaining accessibility and design consistency.

When ready for deployment, the project can be built using `npm run build` and deployed to platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages without additional configuration. The simplicity of Vite’s output and Tailwind’s static styles make for quick deployment and excellent performance out of the box.
